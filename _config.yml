          <p>I have a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (Data Science) from the <a href="https://www.uw.edu/">University of Washington Seattle</a>, and a Bachelor of Technology in
          Mechanical Engineering from <a href="http://www.nitrkl.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Rourkela</a>, India. My undergraduate research report can be accessed 
          <a href="https://moses-varghese.github.io/docs/research_report.pdf"> here</a>. This research led to the publication of a<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.07.024"> 
          research article</a> which I co-authored along with my research professor <a href="https://website.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?e=rkbehera">R.K.Behera</a> and a PhD scholar titled "Coupled nonlinear behavior of beam with a 
          moving mass". This paper addresses the complex nonlinear dynamic behavior of a comprehensive coupled analytical nonlinear geometric model of beam-mass system with their potential applications 
          in engineering design and small-scale electronic devices. My CV can be accessed <a href="/docs/Moses_Prasad_Varghese-CV.pdf">here</a> for more details. The certifications and awards that I achieved can be accessed
